## 🧠 Approach Used
This project uses a **landmark-based approach** for sign language recognition.

Instead of storing or processing raw images, the system extracts **hand landmark coordinates** using MediaPipe Hands. These numerical coordinates are used directly as features for training and prediction.

This approach reduces computational complexity, improves real-time performance, and enhances user privacy.
